### Sprite Sorting and Camera Cullin

Hi, my name is Marc Escandell and this is an introduction to Sprite Sorting and Camera Culling methods

### Introduction

2D video games employ a rendering technique based on sprites, which involves creating small two-dimensional images that are layered on the screen to form the complete game image. As more objects and characters are added to the game, the number of sprites increases, which can slow down game performance and affect the user experience.

To address this issue, optimization methods such as Sprite Sorting and Camera Culling have been developed to allow game developers to improve performance and enhance the user experience.

The use of Sprite Sorting and Camera Culling methods in 2D games dates back to the early days of video games. Game developers have employed these techniques for decades to improve game performance and ensure a smooth gaming experience.

As technology has advanced, so have these methods. Game developers have created more sophisticated algorithms to determine which objects and characters should be rendered at any given time. Additionally, optimization techniques have also been applied to 3D games to enhance performance on complex screens.

In summary, Sprite Sorting and Camera Culling are essential techniques that have been utilized in 2D games for decades. As technology has progressed, these methods have evolved, enabling game developers to create more sophisticated and seamless gaming experiences.
